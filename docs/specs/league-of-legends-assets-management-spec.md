## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Summary

The League of Legends Assets Management feature automatically checks for, downloads, and caches the latest League of Legends game assets on application startup. This ensures that the application always has access to the most up-to-date champion data, images, and other game-related assets without requiring manual updates. The feature will verify if the latest version is already cached locally before downloading, optimizing bandwidth usage and application startup time.

### 1.2 Business Objectives

- Ensure the application always uses the most current League of Legends data
- Reduce maintenance overhead by automating asset updates
- Improve user experience by providing access to the latest champion information and visuals
- Minimize bandwidth usage by implementing intelligent caching

### 1.3 User Value Proposition

This feature ensures that users always have access to the most current League of Legends data without experiencing delays or outdated information. By automatically managing assets in the background, the application can provide a seamless experience with accurate champion statistics, abilities, and visuals.

### 1.4 Scope

- **In Scope**: 
  - Checking for the latest League of Legends version
  - Downloading assets for the latest version if not already cached
  - Decompressing and storing assets in the application's resources folder
  - Implementing version comparison to avoid unnecessary downloads

- **Out of Scope**: 
  - User interface for manually triggering asset updates
  - Partial or selective asset downloads
  - Asset cleanup or archiving of old versions

- **Future Considerations**: 
  - Implementing a cleanup mechanism for old asset versions
  - Adding a progress indicator for asset downloads
  - Providing an API for other components to check asset status

## 2. User Stories and Requirements

### 2.1 User Personas

| Persona | Description | Goals | Pain Points |
|---------|-------------|-------|-------------|
| Application Administrator | Person responsible for deploying and maintaining the application | Minimize manual maintenance tasks | Time spent manually updating game assets |
| End User | Person using the application to analyze League of Legends drafts | Access accurate and up-to-date champion information | Frustration with outdated or missing champion data |

### 2.2 User Stories

#### US-1: Automatic Asset Update Check

As an application administrator, I want the application to automatically check for new League of Legends asset versions on startup, so that I don't have to manually update the assets.

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given the application is starting up, when it initializes, then it should check for the latest League of Legends version.
2. Given the application has detected a new version, when the new version is different from the cached version, then it should download the new assets.
3. Given the application has the latest version already cached, when it starts up, then it should use the cached assets without downloading.

#### US-2: Asset Download and Storage

As an application administrator, I want the downloaded assets to be properly decompressed and stored, so that they can be efficiently accessed by the application.

**Priority**: Must Have

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a new version needs to be downloaded, when the download completes, then the assets should be decompressed correctly.
2. Given the assets have been decompressed, when the process completes, then the assets should be stored in an organized structure in the resources folder.
3. Given the assets are stored, when the application needs to access them, then they should be readily available.

### 2.3 Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement Type | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| Performance | Asset checking should not significantly delay application startup | Version check completes within 2 seconds |
| Performance | Asset download and decompression should be efficient | Complete process for a new version within 5 minutes on standard hardware |
| Reliability | The system should handle network failures gracefully | Application continues to function with previously cached assets if download fails |
| Storage | The system should efficiently manage disk space | Assets are stored in a compressed format when possible |

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Technical Design

#### 3.1.1 Architecture

The League of Legends Assets Management feature will be implemented as a service that runs during application startup. The service will:

1. Check the latest version from the Riot Games API
2. Compare with the locally cached version
3. Download and decompress new assets if needed
4. Make the assets available to the application

```
[Application Startup] → [LoL Assets Service] → [Version Check] → [Download if needed] → [Decompress] → [Cache]
```

#### 3.1.2 Data Model

| Entity | Attributes | Relationships | Changes |
|--------|------------|---------------|---------|
| AssetVersion | version: String, timestamp: LocalDateTime | - | New |
| AssetMetadata | version: String, path: String, lastUpdated: LocalDateTime | - | New |

#### 3.1.3 Sequence Diagrams

```
Application → LoLAssetsService: Initialize
LoLAssetsService → RiotAPI: Get latest version
RiotAPI → LoLAssetsService: Return version list
LoLAssetsService → FileSystem: Check if version exists locally
alt Version does not exist locally
    LoLAssetsService → RiotAPI: Download assets
    RiotAPI → LoLAssetsService: Return compressed assets
    LoLAssetsService → LoLAssetsService: Decompress assets
    LoLAssetsService → FileSystem: Store assets
end
LoLAssetsService → Application: Assets ready
```

### 3.2 Security Considerations

- The application will only download assets from the official Riot Games CDN
- Downloaded files will be validated before decompression to prevent security issues
- No sensitive data is involved in this process

### 3.3 Performance Considerations

- Asset downloads will be performed asynchronously to minimize impact on application startup
- Version checking will use conditional HTTP requests (If-Modified-Since) when possible
- Decompression will be optimized to minimize CPU usage
- Cached assets will be stored efficiently to minimize disk space usage
