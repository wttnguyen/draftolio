# Draftolio AI - Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security policies, authentication requirements, data validation rules, input sanitization standards, and vulnerability prevention measures for the Draftolio AI project.

## Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Implement multiple layers of security controls.
2. **Least Privilege**: Grant the minimum level of access necessary.
3. **Secure by Default**: Systems should be secure out of the box.
4. **Fail Securely**: Errors should not compromise security.
5. **Open Design**: Security should not depend on obscurity.
6. **Economy of Mechanism**: Keep security mechanisms simple.
7. **Complete Mediation**: Check every access to every resource.
8. **Psychological Acceptability**: Security mechanisms should be user-friendly.
9. **Weakest Link**: Security is only as strong as the weakest component.
10. **Privacy by Design**: Protect user privacy at all stages.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication Requirements

1. **Authentication Method**
   - Authentication is exclusively handled through Riot Sign-On (RSO)
   - No local user accounts are created or managed
   - All authentication requests are delegated to RSO

2. **Riot Sign-On (RSO) Implementation**
   - Implement OAuth 2.0 flow with PKCE for Riot Sign-On
   - Request appropriate scopes for accessing Riot ID and summoner information
   - Validate all tokens (signature, expiration, audience, issuer)
   - Use short-lived access tokens (1 hour) and longer-lived refresh tokens (14 days)
   - Securely store Riot access tokens and refresh tokens
   - Handle token refresh and expiration
   - Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
   - Implement token revocation when needed

### Authorization Framework

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Define clear roles with specific permissions
   - Standard roles: Admin, Editor, Viewer, Guest
   - Custom roles for specific business needs

2. **Permission Granularity**
   - Resource-level permissions (e.g., document, template)
   - Action-level permissions (e.g., create, read, update, delete)
   - Field-level permissions for sensitive data

3. **Access Control Implementation**
   - Enforce authorization at the service layer
   - Implement method-level security with Spring Security annotations
   - Use Spring Security's SpEL expressions for complex authorization rules
   - Implement API endpoint authorization with Spring Security

4. **Authorization Checks**
   - Verify authorization for every request
   - Log all authorization failures
   - Return 403 Forbidden (not 404 Not Found) for unauthorized access attempts
   - Implement rate limiting for authorization failures

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

1. **Public Data**
   - Information that can be freely disclosed
   - No special protection required

2. **Internal Data**
   - Information for internal use only
   - Requires authentication to access

3. **Confidential Data**
   - Sensitive business information
   - Requires specific authorization to access
   - Must be encrypted in transit and at rest

4. **Restricted Data**
   - Highly sensitive information (PII, financial data)
   - Requires strict access controls
   - Must be encrypted in transit and at rest
   - Access must be logged and audited

### Encryption Requirements

1. **Data in Transit**
   - Use TLS 1.3 for all communications
   - Enforce HTTPS for all connections
   - Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
   - Use secure TLS configurations (strong ciphers, forward secrecy)

2. **Data at Rest**
   - Encrypt all databases using transparent data encryption
   - Encrypt all file storage
   - Use AES-256 for symmetric encryption
   - Use RSA-2048 or ECC for asymmetric encryption
   - Store encryption keys in a secure key management service

3. **Key Management**
   - Use a dedicated key management service (AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault)
   - Implement key rotation policies
   - Separate encryption keys from application code
   - Implement secure key backup procedures

### Personal Data Handling

1. **Data Minimization**
   - Collect only necessary personal data
   - Define retention periods for all data types
   - Implement automated data deletion after retention period

2. **User Consent**
   - Obtain explicit consent for data collection
   - Allow users to withdraw consent
   - Maintain audit trail of consent

3. **Data Subject Rights**
   - Implement mechanisms for data access requests
   - Support data portability (export in standard formats)
   - Enable data correction and deletion
   - Document all data subject request procedures

4. **Privacy Impact Assessments**
   - Conduct PIAs for new features that process personal data
   - Document privacy risks and mitigation measures
   - Review PIAs regularly

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Input Validation Rules

1. **General Validation Principles**
   - Validate all input on the server side
   - Use positive validation (whitelist) rather than negative (blacklist)
   - Validate data type, format, length, and range
   - Reject invalid input rather than attempting to fix it

2. **Validation Frameworks**
   - Use Jakarta Bean Validation (JSR 380) for Java
   - Use Angular's reactive forms validation for frontend
   - Implement custom validators for complex validation rules

3. **Common Validation Rules**
   - Strings: Check length, character set, format
   - Numbers: Check range, precision
   - Dates: Check range, format
   - Files: Check size, type, content
   - Email: Use RFC 5322 compliant validation
   - URLs: Validate scheme, domain, path

4. **Validation Examples**

```java
// Java validation example
public class DocumentRequest {
    @NotNull(message = "Title is required")
    @Size(min = 1, max = 200, message = "Title must be between 1 and 200 characters")
    @Pattern(regexp = "^[\\p{L}\\p{N}\\s.,!?()-]+$", message = "Title contains invalid characters")
    private String title;
    
    @Size(max = 50000, message = "Content cannot exceed 50,000 characters")
    private String content;
    
    @NotNull(message = "Status is required")
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private DocumentStatus status;
    
    // Getters and setters
}
```

```typescript
// Angular validation example
createDocumentForm = new FormGroup({
  title: new FormControl('', [
    Validators.required,
    Validators.maxLength(200),
    Validators.pattern(/^[\p{L}\p{N}\s.,!?()-]+$/u)
  ]),
  content: new FormControl('', [
    Validators.maxLength(50000)
  ]),
  status: new FormControl('DRAFT', [
    Validators.required
  ])
});
```

### Input Sanitization Standards

1. **HTML Sanitization**
   - Sanitize all user-generated HTML content
   - Use DOMPurify in the frontend
   - Use OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer in the backend
   - Define allowlists for tags, attributes, and protocols

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Use parameterized queries or prepared statements
   - Never concatenate user input into SQL strings
   - Use ORM frameworks (Hibernate, JPA) with proper configuration
   - Implement least privilege database accounts

3. **XSS Prevention**
   - Encode output based on context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL)
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
   - Use Angular's built-in sanitization for templates
   - Implement XSS protection headers

4. **CSRF Protection**
   - Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations
   - Use SameSite cookie attribute (Strict or Lax)
   - Verify Origin and Referer headers
   - Implement Spring Security CSRF protection

5. **Sanitization Examples**

```java
// Java HTML sanitization example
import org.owasp.html.PolicyFactory;
import org.owasp.html.Sanitizers;

PolicyFactory policy = Sanitizers.FORMATTING
    .and(Sanitizers.BLOCKS)
    .and(Sanitizers.LINKS);
String safeHtml = policy.sanitize(untrustedHtml);
```

```typescript
// Angular HTML sanitization example
import { DomSanitizer, SafeHtml } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({...})
export class DocumentViewComponent {
  private sanitizer = inject(DomSanitizer);
  
  getSafeHtml(content: string): SafeHtml {
    // Only use for trusted content that needs to preserve HTML
    return this.sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustHtml(content);
  }
}
```
